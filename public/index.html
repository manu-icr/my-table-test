          The final project in our course is a particularly interesting one.
          We'll be developing a children's game called "Table-Tests" that helps
          children to practice their multiplication and their handwriting at the
          same time!
        </p>
        <p>
          This might sound like a complex task, but it's been made simple by a
          library called TensorFlow.js, developed by Google. TFJS, as we'll
          refer to it, is a JavaScript library for deploying machine learning
          (ML) models in the browser. If you don't know anything about ML, don't
          worry! Nor did I when I set-out to create this course, and my
          knowledge of it is still far from sophisticated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, for our purposes, we don't need to understand ML in order
          to use it in our app. In the following chapter, I'll walk you through
          how to include the TFJS library and integrate it with our components.

          This a about as basic of a game as there can be. But even so, there
          are actually several inter-depended components at play, and over the
          course of this project we'll be looking at how they are constructed
          together. There will be a greater emphasis on source-code exploration
          in this project. I've tried to provide detailed comments in my code to
          explain what is going-on, so if you ever feel stuck, try going to the
          source and seeing if there are any hints as to what's going on.
